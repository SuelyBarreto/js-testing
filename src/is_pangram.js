/*
Testing
1. Success-case input for Pangram - 
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
The five boxing wizards jump quickly
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz
John quickly extemporized five tow bags
Waltz, nymph, for quick jigs vex Bud
Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim

2. Nominal failure, a clear failure case (i.e, a string with only 10 letters)

3. An edge-case failure (i.e, a string with all the letters but one)

4. Another edge-case failure
